A trivial code line counter for diff.

You can get line counts from git or svn diff.

Input `git diff` or `svn diff` with pipe.

```
$ git diff | ./tloc.py
```
Or, assign a patch file.

```
$ git diff > patchfile; ./tloc.py patchfile
```

tloc print the line counts per file like below:

```
Name          Code Comment Blank
--------------------------------
.gitignore  +    2       0     0
            -    0       0     0
LISENCE.txt +    0      16     9
            -    0       0     0
README.md   +    0      19     3
            -    0       0     0
tloc.py     +  115      35    40
            -    0       0     0
--------------------------------
Total       +  117      70    52
            -    0       0     0
```

Note that this tool cannot count the comment lines strictly. Some comment lines
are considered as real lines.
